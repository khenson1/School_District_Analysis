# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to compare two different analyses; One with all the school district's overall reading and math scores, and one where the ninth grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School are replaced due to academic dishonesty. I did this analysis to see how the changes would affect the overall report of all the total school districts' high schools.

## Results

## Summary:
In summary, the replacement of Thomas High School’s 9th grade math and reading scores had very small changes to the overall averages, spending, and passing percentages. 

Notable changes:
•	The overall performance statistics for Thomas High School decreased. 
•	The 9th grade math and reading scores displayed "NAN" instead of numerical values.
•	There were decreases in the scores based on school spending and the scores based on school size, but they were almost unmeasurable.
